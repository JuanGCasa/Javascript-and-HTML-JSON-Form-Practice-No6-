# **Javascript-and-HTML-JSON-Form-Practice-No6-**

## *Practice No6 for the Java Bootcamp*

This repo is a simple demostration of a frontend table feeding on a JSON file and a User creation with simple front validations of its fields.
*The files are all in one folder because they were few and more complex organization would be a waste of time*

Remember to test this within a local server to avoid CORS problems.
